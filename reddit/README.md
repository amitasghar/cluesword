# CluesWord

A daily trivia word puzzle game for Reddit — guess the word from progressive clues!

## Overview

CluesWord combines trivia knowledge with word-guessing mechanics. Each puzzle gives you up to 3 clues of increasing specificity. Guess the word with fewer clues to earn a higher score. Green letters mean correct placement, yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.

## How to Play

1. Read the first clue and type your guess
2. If incorrect, a second (easier) clue is revealed
3. A third and final clue gives you one last chance

**Scoring:**
